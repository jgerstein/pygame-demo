# Pygame Demo

Based on code by [Pete Shinners](https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/PygameIntro.html)

In order to run this code, you'll need Pygame installed on your computer. If you're working on UCTECH54, it's already installed. If you're workign on another computer and get an error that it can't be imported, then you need to install it. You can do it with one of the following commands (try the first one, if it doesn't work use the second one):

```
$ python3 -m pip install pygame
$ python -m pip install pygame
```

Run the code, see what happens, and see how much you understand of it. We'll use this repo for the second day of Git practice.
