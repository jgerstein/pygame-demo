# Pygame Demo

Based on code by [Pete Shinners](https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/PygameIntro.html)

In order to run this code, you will need to install Pygame by doing the following. Remember that you do not include the dollar sign - it represents your command prompt

```
$ pip install pygame
```

Run the code, see what happens, and see how much you understand of it. We'll use this repo for the second day of Git practice.
